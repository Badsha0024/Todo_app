Let users click a checkbox or button to toggle task completion without reloading the page.

Use fetch() or jQuery + Django views.

Use FullCalendar or render tasks by due date in a calendar format.

6. Tag System

Let users search/filter tasks by tags like "urgent", "home", "meeting".

Use JavaScript + Bootstrap theme switch to support dark/light UI.

8. Progress Bar / Task Stats
Show a visual progress bar:
Completed Tasks / Total Tasks.

Allow users to leave personal notes or updates on a task.

10. Task Sharing or Collaboration
